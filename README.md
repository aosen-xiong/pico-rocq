# Pico Rocq Artifact

This repository contains the Rocq/Coq mechanization for the Pico language.  The
core artifact claims are organized around type soundness, immutability, and
readonly guarantees.

Top-level theorem entry points:

- `Preservation.v`: `preservation_pico`
- `DeepImmutability.v`: `shallow_immutability_pico`, `deep_immutability_pico`
- `ReadonlySafety.v`: `readonly_pico_field_write`,
  `readonly_method_call_preserves_arguments`
- `ConcreteImmutability.v`: `ConcreteImmutability`
- `WFNOMutationEXP.v`: `well_typed_no_mutation_exp`

## Toolchain

- Rocq/Coq: `9.1.0`
- OCaml: `5.2.1`
- `coq-record-update`: `0.3.4`

## Artifact verification

The recommended reviewer command is:

```sh
make check
```

This builds all Rocq sources and checks that the submitted proof files do not
use forbidden `Axiom`, `Admitted`, or `admit` declarations outside the bundled
`LibTactics.v` support library.

The same checks can be run separately:

```sh
dune build @default -j"$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)"
python3 scripts/check-no-axioms-admits.py .
```

## Build (current Make-based workflow)

1. Generate the Makefile:
   ```sh
   coq_makefile -f _RocqProject -o Makefile
   ```
2. Build:
   ```sh
   make -j"$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)"
   ```

## Build with dune (recommended command)

```sh
dune build @default -j"$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)"
```

This repository currently uses dune as a frontend wrapper over the existing
`_RocqProject` + `coq_makefile` build, so `dune build` and CI stay reliable.
Generated files such as `CoqMakefile*`, `.vo`, `.vos`, `.vok`, `.glob`, and
`_build/` are ignored and are not part of the source artifact.

## Reproducible setup with opam

This repository includes `pico-coq.opam` so dependencies can be installed in an
isolated switch.

```sh
# From the repo root
opam switch create . 5.2.1
eval "$(opam env)"

# Pin this package and install only its dependencies
opam pin add . -n
opam install . --deps-only

# Build (dune wrapper)
dune build @default -j"$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)"
```

## Notes

- `dune` and `_RocqProject` builds are both available during transition.
- The opam package build uses `dune build`.
- `WFNOMutationEXP.v` proves a preservation-style mutation-safety claim:
  well-typed field writes do not produce a mutation exception.
